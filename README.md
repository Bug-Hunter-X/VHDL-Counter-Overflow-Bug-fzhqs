# VHDL Counter with Potential Overflow

This repository contains a VHDL counter with a potential overflow bug. The original code does not correctly handle the upper bound of the counter, potentially leading to unexpected behavior during simulation or synthesis.

A corrected version is provided that addresses the overflow issue, ensuring that the counter behaves as intended.
